# Recipe Flask App

## Installation

Open the hello.py in an IDE of your choice.

Open the Terminal and cd to the correct directory

When you reach project, you must arm the hello file:

```
$env:FLASK_APP = "hello"
```

From there you run Flask

```
python - m flask run
```

Once this is done, you copy your local URL into the browser!

That is it!
